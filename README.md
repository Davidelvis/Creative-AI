# Product design and development in machine learning

## Overview

There have been a lot of articles, videos, research papers, etc. from the machine learning community on MadewithML platform lately and I want to be able to organize all of it. I want to be able to attach relevant (explicit and implicit) tags to the content so that the users can discover them when they need it.

## Relevance

<b> Core business values /b> One of the core business values of the platform is to provide the curation that the users are not able to find anywhere else. Therefore, itâ€™s a top priority to ensure that the platform meet this core value.

<b> Engagement </b> When the users are able to discover the precise resources for their needs, this drives engagement on the platform and improves perceived value. If they had addressed the search related complaints over the last X months, it would have increased engagement by X% leading to Y% increase in sponsorship fees.
